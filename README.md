### Step 2: Exclude `README.md` from Jekyll Processing

1. **Edit `_config.yml`**:
   - Open the `_config.yml` file in your project.
   - Add `README.md` to the `exclude` list:

   ```yaml
   title: Your Site Title
   description: A brief description of your site
   theme: jekyll-theme-primer

   exclude:
     - README.md

   plugins:
     - jekyll-seo-tag
     - jekyll-gist
     - jekyll-paginate
     - jekyll-relative-links
     - jekyll-optional-front-matter
     - jekyll-readme-index
     - jekyll-default-layout
